## 🚀 I Built a Full-Stack E-Commerce MVP in 5 Days — Here’s How It Went!

Over the past few days, I challenged myself to build and deploy a fully functional **e-commerce platform** from scratch. I’m excited to share that it’s complete — featuring user and admin panels, product management, payment setup, analytics, and deployment across multiple platforms.

> 📌 **Note**: I’ve been working with React for some time, but this was my **first-ever project using Next.js**. I decided to step up and learn modern full-stack development — and this project was my way of diving in head first.

This was more than just a coding sprint — it was a deep dive into real-world problem solving, debugging, scaling, and learning. Here's a breakdown of what I did, how I built it, and the lessons I took away.

### 🛠️ Project Overview: **DP-Store**

An MVP for an online store with:

* 🌐 Public user interface (product listing, cart, wishlist, etc.)
* 🛒 Product and category browsing
* 🔐 Authentication (Google + email/password)
* 🧑‍💼 Admin dashboard (manage users, orders, products)
* 📊 Sales analytics
* 💳 **Payment flow integrated with order tracking**
* 🖼️ Cloudinary-based image upload
* 📦 Firebase Firestore as the database

### ⚙️ Tech Stack

| Layer           | Tools / Libraries                                |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Frontend (User) | Next.js, Zustand, Tailwind CSS, Keen Slider      |
| Admin Dashboard | Next.js App Router, Zustand, Firebase Auth       |
| Backend API     | Node.js, Express, Firebase Firestore, Cloudinary |
| Auth            | Google, GitHub, Email/Password                   |
| Deployment      | Vercel (Frontend), Google Cloud Run (Backend)    |
| Image Hosting   | Cloudinary                                       |
| **Payments**    | **Payment API integration for order handling**   |

### 🗓️ Timeline – **5-Day MVP Challenge**

**Day 1**: Initial planning, wireframing, and setting up project repo
**Day 2–3**: Core development (frontend + backend APIs + Firebase setup)
**Day 4**: Admin dashboard, image upload, analytics, and state management
**Day 5**: Final polish, bug fixing, deployment attempts, and UI/UX improvements

---

### ☁️ Deployment Journey

I tried multiple deployment options:

* 🚫 Railway: Faced repeated build errors and delays in domain resolution
* ✅ Docker: Successfully containerized and tested locally
* ✅ Final deployment on Google Cloud Run (backend) + Vercel (frontend)

It wasn’t smooth sailing — but debugging these real-world deployment issues was the most valuable part.

### 💡 Key Learnings

* 🔥 Build fast, but build modular — MVP doesn’t mean messy
* 💬 Zustand + Firebase is a powerful combo for lean teams
* 🐛 Deployment always takes more time than expected
* 🌍 Cloud services are tricky, but rewarding once it works
* 🎯 Consistent UI/UX pays off big time, even for internal tools
